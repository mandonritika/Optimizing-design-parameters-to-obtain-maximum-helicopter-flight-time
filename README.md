# DOE_Helicopter-Flight-Time
This project aims at improving the design of a paper helicopter by selecting the optimal design factors, such that it has the longest possible
flight time. It uses concepts of Plackett-Burman and Hamada Wu design principles. The conclusion
discusses about the significant factors that will help us achieve the longest possible flight time

Plackett-Burman design is used for screening experiments i.e. it aids in estimating significant
factors. This design helps eliminate factors that are not significant for the experiment but can do
so in fewer data points than what would be required by another design of experiment technique
like the full factorial design method. A typical full factorial design for 6 factors with 2 levels each
would need 2! runs i.e., 64 runs. Plackett Burman, on the other hand, overcomes this problem and
proves to be much more economical, time saving and convenient by needing only 12 runs for this
experiment. When screening experiments are considered, Plackett-Burman is the more widely used
for these very reasons.

For this project, the orthogonal array technique of Plackett Burman design-OA
(12,2"") which uses 12 runs and 11 factors with 2 levels each. Out of the 11 factors, 6 factors (6 columns) are randomly selected which are used in selecting the levels of each factor while designing the paper helicopters. The remaining 5 factors are not a part of the experiment but have
been included as they are part of the Plackett- Burman OA (12, 2"") planning matrix. They are represented using columns 7 to 11 but they hold no value or
significance for the experiment. A total of 12 different combinations of factor-levels are obtained
i.e., 12 different paper helicopters with different combinations of levels for all the factors.

3 sets (3 replication) of helicopters are designed, with 12 different combinations of 6 factor levels for each set. The experimental observations can be seen from table 3.

After taking the observations, location (average response time) and dispersion is calculated. The
location and dispersion values are used to develop the half normal plots and select the significant
factors.
