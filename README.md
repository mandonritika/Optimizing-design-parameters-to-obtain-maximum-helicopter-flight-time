# DOE_Helicopter-Flight-Time
This project aims at improving the design of a paper helicopter by selecting the optimal design factors, such that it has the longest possible
flight time. It uses concepts of Plackett-Burman and Hamada Wu design principles. The conclusion
discusses about the significant factors that will help us achieve the longest possible flight time
